RSA vs AES — quick notes (Week 4)
• RSA (asymmetric): public/private keys; slower; used for small data or to wrap symmetric keys.
• AES-256 (symmetric): shared key; very fast; used for bulk data.
• Best practice: RSA encrypts the AES key; AES encrypts the file contents.
• Performance: AES >> RSA for large files.
• Use cases: RSA for identity/key exchange; AES for data at rest/in transit.
