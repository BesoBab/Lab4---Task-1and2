TLS Handshake Explanation
------------------------------------------------------------
The TLS handshake I captured illustrates how my MacBook established an encrypted session with www.wikipedia.org.
The process began when my device sent a Client Hello message advertising its supported TLS versions and cipher suites.
The server replied with a Server Hello, choosing TLS 1.3 and the cipher suite AEAD-CHACHA20-POLY1305-SHA256 to secure communication.

Immediately after, the server transmitted its digital certificate, allowing my browser to verify the server’s authenticity and validity through a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
Once validated, both endpoints used ephemeral elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) key exchange to derive a unique session key.
From that moment forward, all data transferred between my system and the server was encrypted and integrity-protected, ensuring that no external party could view or modify the traffic.

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Protection Mechanisms
------------------------------------------------------------
TLS 1.3 provides multiple built-in defenses against MITM attacks:

1. Authentication – The browser verifies the server’s digital certificate and CA signature. If a certificate is invalid or spoofed, the browser displays a warning and blocks the connection.
2. Confidentiality – The ECDHE handshake generates new symmetric session keys for each connection, achieving forward secrecy. Even if an attacker later obtained the server’s private key, past sessions remain secure.
3. Integrity – All encrypted records include authentication tags (via AEAD), ensuring that any tampered packet is immediately detected and discarded.

Together, these steps prevent attackers from intercepting, impersonating, or altering data in transit.

TLS in Website Communication
------------------------------------------------------------
In my capture, the Client Hello and Server Hello messages show how the two parties negotiate encryption parameters:

- Protocol: TLS 1.3
- Cipher Suite: AEAD-CHACHA20-POLY1305-SHA256

After the handshake, the server sent its certificate, completing authentication.
TLS then derived symmetric keys from the ECDHE exchange, establishing a secure tunnel for HTTPS traffic.
From this point, every HTTP request and response was encrypted, providing confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity for all communication with the website.

------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
------------------------------------------------------------
This TLS 1.3 handshake demonstrates modern web security in practice.
By combining strong authentication, forward secrecy, and authenticated encryption, HTTPS ensures that users can safely exchange information without risk of interception or manipulation.
The specific negotiation — TLS 1.3 / CHACHA20-POLY1305-SHA256 — reflects a high-performance, state-of-the-art configuration widely adopted across secure web services.
